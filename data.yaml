# In general things are identified to the system only by their IDs.  This means that if you want to
# change the name of something, or how much it costs, you can do so without causing confusion.
# (Changing costs will update all outstanding balances automatically.)

# If you add a new entry, make sure it gets an unused ID.

# If you want to delete an entry, the system will gracefully delete all associated reservations.
# You might want to look at whether any such reservations exist first, though.
